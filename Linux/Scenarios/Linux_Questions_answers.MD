## How to increse the number of files to open in linux:
---------------------------------------------------

to increase open file limit to 500000, you can use the following command as root:

	sysctl -w fs.file-max=500000
	
	# cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
	
		Note: With the above command the changes you have made will only remain active until the next reboot. If you wish to apply them permanently, you will have to edit the following file:
		
		# vi /etc/sysctl.conf
		
		Add this line in file : 
			fs.file-max=500000

ulimit :
--------------------------

ulimit is admin access required Linux shell command which is used to see, set, or limit the resource usage of the current user. It is used to return the number of open file descriptors for each process. It is also used to set restrictions on the resources used by a process.

ulimt -u
ulimit -a   -> for all

- showing the maximum file size a user can have.
	ulimt -f
	
- To display maximum users process or for showing maximum user process limit for the logged-in user.
	ulimit -u
	
- Set Ulimit temporarley
	ulimit -u 12345

- Set Ulimit permanentley 
	vim /etc/security/limits.conf


/var/log/messages

How to check the remote server port open or not
-----------------------------------------------

-> netcat

	nc -zvw3 192.168.1.8 22
		nc: Itâ€™s a command.
		z: zero-I/O mode (used for scanning).
		v: For verbose.
		w3: timeout wait seconds
		192.168.1.8: Destination system IP.
		22: Port number needs to be verified.
		
-> nmap
	
	nmap 192.168.1.8 -p 22
	
-> telnet

	telnet 192.168.1.9 22


How to Identify the Ip addr is a Private or Public
---------------------------------------------------

Below lenth got reserved for Private Network

		192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (65,536 IP addresses)
		172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (1,048,576 IP addresses)
		10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (16,777,216 IP addresses)

Check CPU utilization
--------------------------

   mpstat
   
Check Subnet Mask address
-----------------------------

	netstat -r

Modify a file located in Remote server:
-----------------------------------

	ssh -t user1@computer1 'vim /path/laboratory_notebook_1.md'

		-t = force sudo
		
Copy files to remote server:
-----------------------------

	we have lot of ways like scp , sftp , rsync etc
	
	scp : 
	
		scp -r file/folder user1@computer1:/path/
		
Find a Word
------------
- Find a word in a file

	  grep "word" filename

- Find a Word in a folder-inside-folder and file
  	
	  grep -Rw /home/reddredd/ -e "apk update"

  -R == read all files under each directory, recursively
  -w == Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words
  -e == specify the string (pattern) to be searched
  
- Print the output execpt a word containig words 
  
 	 grep -v "anand" filename.txt

Repalce a Word
------------

- sed -i 's/original/new/g' file.txt

	Explanation:

		sed = Stream EDitor
		-i = in-place (i.e. save back to the original file)
		The command string:

		s = the substitute command
		original = a regular expression describing the word to replace (or just the word itself)
		new = the text to replace it with
		g = global (i.e. replace all and not just the first occurrence)
		file.txt = the file name

- Replace a word in first accurence
	
  	sed -i 's/original/new/1' file.txt
  
- Replace a word in Second accurence
  
  	sed -i 's/original/new/2' file.txt

Find a File
------------

- Find an Empty file

  	find . -type f -empty

- Find a file
  
  	find / -type f -name *.cer

- find -name "test*"

- find -iname "query"  // -iname is for ignoring the case sensitive

- Find a file with less than a specified size
  	
	  find / -size -50c

		c: bytes
		k: Kilobytes
		M: Megabytes
		G: Gigabytes
		b: 512-byte blocks

- Find a file with Greater than a specified size
  
  	find / -size +700M
  
- Find a file less than perticula size
  
  	find . -type f -size -1M

- Finding by Owner and Permissions
  
  	find / -perm -644

- Time
	Linux stores time data about access times, modification times, and change times.

	Access Time: Last time a file was read or written to.
	Modification Time: Last time the contents of the file were modified.
	Change Time: Last time the file's inode meta-data was changed.

   - To find files that have a modification time of a day ago, type:
   
   	  find / -mtime -1
     

   - If we want files that were accessed in less than a day ago, we can type:
     
     	find / -atime -1
     
   - Find the files created by a perticular interval
     
     	find /root -newermt "2018-01-01" ! -newermt "2019-11-23"

- awk '{print $1,$2}' Dockerfile

count the lines in a file
-------------------------

- awk 'END {print NR}' Dockerfile

- wc -l Dockerfile

Find the modified files in specified time
-----------------------------------------
- find . -type f -newermt "2019-01-22 00:00:00" \! -newermt "2019-02-22 13:23:00"
- find /root -newermt "2018-01-01" ! -newermt "2019-11-23"

xargs
-----------------------
  
        Xargs is a great command that reads streams of data from standard input, then generates and executes command lines; 
	meaning it can take output of a command and passes it as argument of another command. If no command is specified, 
	xargs executes echo by default. You many also instruct it to read data from a file instead of stdin.
        
		  1] echo "anand" | xargs mkdir
		     o/p : anand dir will create

		  2] ls -ltr | xargs
		    o/p: It will listout all the output into one line

		  3] Remove a file name end with .html
		    find . -name "*.html" -type f -print | xargs rm -f

		  4] find lins/words/charecters in all files
		     ls | xargs wc

		  2] test 5 -eq 7 && echo "same" || echo "not"
		      o/p : not

		  3] test two files which one created first ??
		    test file1 -nt file2 && echo "newer" || echo "nor"  // -nt --> newer than. 
		    -ot --> older than

		  4] check it is a directory
		    test -d new_dir && echo "yes". // -f --> for file
      
lsof - list open files
----------------------------
 
          lsof meaning â€˜LiSt Open Filesâ€™ is used to find out which files are open by which process. As we all know Linux/Unix 
	  considers everything as a files (pipes, sockets, directories, devices etc). One of the reason to use lsof command is 
	  when a disk cannot be unmounted as it says the files are being used. With the help of this command we can easily 
	  identify the files which are in use.
          
          
		  1] List User Specific Opened Files
		    lsof -u anand

		  2] Find Processes running on Specific Port
		    lsof -i TCP:8080

		  3] List Open Files of TCP Port ranges 1-1024
		    lsof -i TCP:80-8080

		  4] List all Network Connections
		     lsof -i

		  5] Find Out whoâ€™s Looking What Files and Commands?
		    lsof -i -u tecmint

		  6] search by PID
		    lsof -p 1

		  7] Kill all Activity of Particular User
		    kill -9 `lsof -t -u anand`
disk
---------

	  - lsblk ( list of avilable block devices)
	  - blkid ( list out th UUID of block device )

		  echo ${10}
		  echo ${11}

		ex:

		echo There is $# parameters
		while [ $# -ne 0 ]; do
			 echo $1
			 shift
		    done

		o/p: Will:/home> ./script a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
