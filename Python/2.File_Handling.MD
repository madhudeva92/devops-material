## File Handling

        Python too supports file handling and allows users to handle files i.e., to read and write files, 
        along with many other file handling options, to operate on files. The concept of file handling has
        stretched over various other languages, but the implementation is either complicated or lengthy, 
        but alike other concepts of Python, this concept here is also easy and short.
        
  Files can be Handled in two ways : 
  
              1. By using Object
              2. By Contaxt Manager ( using With)
              
              Note : Contaxt Manager is better to use. Because, No need to close the file explisitly after your work. Also, if it found any exceptions in the middle of the execution then it will close the file too.
              
  Using Object : 
  
            - Open a File ( By deafult it is in Read mode )
                f = open('data.txt')
              
            - Display the File Name 
                f = open('data.txt')
                print(f.name)

            - Display the File Open Mode
                f = open('data.txt','r')
                print(f.mode)
            
            - Different types of Modes
                    “ r “, for reading.
                    “ w “, for writing.
                    “ a “, for appending.
                    “ r+ “, for both reading and writing
                    
            - Open in Read Mode
                f = open('data.txt','r')
                print(f.read()) 
                
            - Open in Write Mode
                f = open('data.txt','w')
                f.write('Adding fifth line')
                
            - Append the Data
                f = open('data.txt','a')
                f.write('Adding sixth line')
                
            - Read & Write 
              ‘r+’ – Special read and write mode, which is used to handle both actions when working with a file
                f = open('data.txt','r+')
                
            - Close a File
                f.close()
        
  Using Contaxt Manager:
    
            - Read all the Data in a file
                    with open('data.txt','r') as f:
                            text = f.read()
                            print(text)
                            
            - Read a First Single Line
                    with open('data.txt','r') as f:
                            text = f.readline()
                            print(text)
                            
            - Read all contetnt of file in single line
                    with open('data.txt','r') as f:
                            text = f.readlines()
                            print(text)
            
            - Read first 10 charecters of a file
                    with open('data.txt','r') as f:
                            text = f.read(10)
                            print(text)

            - Print Current position of Method
                   with open('data.txt','r') as f:
                            text = f.read(10)
                            print(f.tell())

            - Content Overriding 
                   with open('data.txt','w') as f:
                            f.write('Tant')
                            f.seek(0)
                            f.write('A')
             
              
              
              
  Scenario : 
  
  - Copy the Content from Original file to Copy File.
  
                  with open('data.txt','r') as rf:
                       with open('data-copy.txt','w') as wf:
                                for line in rf:
                                         wf.write(line)

              
  Files Types:
  
        There are 2 types of files mainly: 
                1. Text   ( Deal with Files)
                2. Binary ( Mainly deal with Images)
                
        - With Images
          
           -  Copy the Content from Original Image to Copy Image. ( b for Bytes )
           
                   with open('data.txt','rb') as rf:
                       with open('data-copy.txt','wb') as wf:
                                for line in rf:
                                         wf.write(line)
